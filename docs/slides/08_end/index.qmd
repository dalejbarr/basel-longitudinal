# Generalized Linear (Mixed) Models

## Discrete data {.smaller}

- categorical (dichotomous/polychotomous)
  - type of linguistic structure produced (X, Y, Z)
  - region viewed in a visual world study
  - number of items recalled out of N
  - accurate or inaccurate selection
  - hired or not hired
  - Likert scales

- counts (no. opportunities ill-defined)
  - no. of speech errors in a corpus
  - no. of turn shifts in a conversation
  - no. words in a utterance

## Why not treat discrete data as continuous?

- Proportions range between 0 and 1
- Variance proportional to the mean (expected probability or rate)
- Spurious interactions due to scaling effects

## Generalized linear models {.smaller}

- Allows use of regular linear regression by projecting the DV onto an appropriate scale

- Key elements of GLMs: 
  - link function
  - variance function

| data    | approach            | link  | variance | function                            |
|---------|---------------------|-------|----------|-------------------------------------|
| binary  | logistic regression | logit | binomial | `glm()`, `lme4::glmer()`            |
| count   | Poisson regression  | log   | Poisson  | `glm()`, `lme4::glmer()`            |
| ordinal | ordinal regression  | logit | binomial | `ordinal::clm()`, `ordinal::clmm()` |

# Logistic regression

## Odds and log odds {.smaller}

| term              | definition                               |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------|
| *Bernoulli trial* | An event with a binary outcome, with one considered a 'success'                                             |
| *proportion*      | A ratio of successes to the total number of Bernoulli trials, proportion of days of the week that are Wednesday is 1/7 or about .14 |
| *odds*            | A ratio of successes to non-successes, i.e., odds of a day being Wednesday are 1 to 6, natural odds= 1/6 = .17                      |
| *log odds*        | The (natural) log of the odds (turns multiplicative effects into additive effects)                                                  |

## Estimating logit models {.smaller}

- single-level data, bernoulli trials
  
  `mod <- glm(DV ~ IV, family = binomial(link = "logit"), ...)`

- single-level data, binomial counts
  
  `mod <- glm(cbind(Y, K) ~ IV, family = binomial(link = "logit"), ...)`
  
  where K = N - Y

- multi-level data: same, but use `lme4::glmer()`

# Generalized Additive Mixed Models (GAMMs)

## What are GAMMs?

![](img/GAMMs.png)

- for "small" datasets, fit using `mgcv::gam()`
- for "large" datasets, fit using `mgcv::bam()`

## How to fit GAMMs?

You can fit LMMs with GAMM functions.

ML data with within-factor A (A1, A2) and between-factor B (B1, B2)

```{r}
#| eval: false
# these models are equivalent
mgcv::bam(Y ~ A * B +
            s(subj_id, bs = "re") + s(subj_id, A, bs = "re"),
          data = dat)

lme4::lmer(Y ~ A * B + (1 + A || subj_id), data = dat)
```

## Fitting wiggly patterns

```{r}
#| eval: false
mgcv::bam(Y ~ A * B +
            s(t, bs = "tp") + # wiggly effect of tnum
            s(subj_id, t, bs = "fs") + # factor smooth
            s(subj_id, A, bs = "re"), # random slope
          data = dat)
```

## A word about temporal autocorrelation

If you randomized, you are probably OK; the worst you can expect is a mild hit to power.
